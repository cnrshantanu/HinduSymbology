<div data-role="content">	
<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>Vishnu the root of the name, which refers to “Settle”. The interpretation of Vishnu is, ‘the all pervading one’ or ‘the one who resides into everything’. Alternatively, it can be perceived as the existence of core qualities of Vishnu in a person.</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>The name Vishnu is first mentioned in the Rig Veda, and is denoted as a minor deity, often invoked as a companion of Indra. Vishnu became a more prevalent deity post Mahabhartha era.
</p>

<p>Vishnu is a continuum to Narayana and has the latter’s core characteristics, which has been explained in the Narayana section. Vishnu is shown in Blue color, which signifies infinity (since sky and oceans look blue and depict infinity). This infinity refers to the concept of being able to realize one’s infinite inner self. Vishnu’s symbolism repeatedly reminds a man to listen to the inner voice, which comes from within one’s soul. The conscience can be cultivated by doing deeds, which relate to the realities of nature and life.</p>

<p>Vishnu continually inspires to live a spiritual life devoid of material and sensual pleasures.
Symbology of the ten incarnations of Vishnu also has profound scientific meaning attached to it giving some sort of scientific and historic relevance of evolution of living organisms from protoplasmic invertebrates (Matsaya Avatar) to mammals (Varaha Avatar) to incomplete development of Man (Vamana Avatar) to a completely developed Human being with values and intellect like Rama and Krishna. 
</p>



<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>Vishnu is the Supreme God in the Vaishnavite tradition of Hinduism. Scriptures dictate that whenever righteousness (good) falls and unrighteousness (evil) grows Vishnu reveals his presence. The Supreme though unborn and undying, takes a human form to overthrow the forces of ignorance and selfishness.
Vishnu is also described in the Bhagavad Gita (Prevalent Hindu Scripture) as having a 'Universal Form' (Vishvarupa) which is beyond the ordinary limits of human perception or imagination.</p>

<p>Vishnu takes form as an all-inclusive deity, known as Purusha or Mahapurusha, Paramatma [Supreme Soul], Antaryami [All-knowing], and he is the Sheshin [Totality] in whom all souls are contained.</p>
