<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from its elemental form ‘laks’, meaning "to perceive or observe". This is synonymous with lak?ya, meaning "aim" or "objective". Lakshmi’s root meaning is the mark of fortune, wealth and prosperity. The interpretation is that a being can make a mark only by having valuable possession of wealth and prosperity. 
</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
Lakshmi is Vishnu’s consort who signifies that for maintenance of the world, one needs wealth. This does not signify only amassing material wealth. The core concept conveyed via Lakhsmi’s symbology is that she inspires one to increase their moral and ethical wealth. These are the pre-requisites for any kind of wealth. One needs to first prosper intellectually to prosper financially.
</p>

<p>
She is generally worshipped by most Indians but especially by the trader and business class. The reason behind this is that one needs to be honest and righteous to excel in any kind of venture and to make it profitable for the society along with his or her own self.
</p>

<p>
The presence of Lakshmi’s elder twin has an incredible significance attached to it. It explains that one should respect the possibility of misfortune in their lives. One must accept that if they can get wealthy, they can also suffer losses both financial and material. If one can accept this fact then they will remain cautious and be prudent in the decisions they make in all walks of life.
</p>



<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Lakshmi has an elder twin called Alakshmi, who is the goddess of strife and misfortune. She always accompanies Lakshmi in the form of a white owl. A legend says that once a trader in his dreams saw Lakshmi and Alakhsmi paying him a visit. He was asked by each of them that who was more beautiful or in other terms more sought after. Trader did not want to offend either of them and very carefully answered. He said that “Lakshmi looks beautiful when she is coming towards me and Alakshmi looks beautiful when she is going away from me.” 
</p>
