<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>Natya means Dance and Raja means King or Lord. The interpretation of Nataraja relates to the king of Dance who destroys the weary universe by dancing upon it. It also depicts dance as a powerful expression of art.</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
Nataraja performs the cosmic dance called as Anandatandava, which refers to, ‘the Dance of Bliss’ signifying the union of cosmic cycles of destruction followed by creation and also the continuity of birth and death. The image of Nataraj is paradoxical with the representation of five activities at once namely, Shrishti or creation, Sthiti or preservation, Samhara or destruction, Tirobhava or illusion and Aungraha or release.
</p>

<p>
Scientists have related the dance of Shiva or Nataraj with the cosmic dance performed by subatomic particles. Even subatomic particles undergo a continuous process of creation and destruction without any conceivable end. Hence, Nataraja’s dance can be said to signify the only natural phenomenon constant in the cosmos – destruction followed by creation and vice versa.

</p>



<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Sages Patanjali and Vyagrapada were doing penance in the Thillai forests to have darshan of Lord Shiva. One day in ThillaiVanam or the mangroves forests, Shiva was strolling through assuming the form of a Bhikshatana (the Supreme Beggar) with Vishnu as his consort, who had assumed the form of Mohini. Their irradiant beauty and grace mesmerized all the other ascetics and their wives. The saints seeing their wives all enchanted with the Bhikshatana and his consort were enraged and tried to come in Shiva’s way. Their pride was quelled when Shiva killed the Tiger, which emanated from a Holy fire started by the Sages, and adorned its hide. Even the serpents, which originated from the fire, coiled around Shiva’s hair. Symbolically he crushed the dwarf demon of egoism and pride into the ground and the Sages bowed down in reverence to Lord Shiva.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, the residing deity of the mangrove forest, Goddess Kali challenged Shiva to compete in a Dance competition. Both of them showed exemplary skills until the time Shiva picked up his left Ear ring from the ground with his right feet and wore it back in one graceful move. That is when Goddess Kali surrendered to him. This is how Shiva was termed as the Lord of Dance or the Nataraja. The symbology of the most prevalent bronze idol of Nataraja relates aptly with these legends.
