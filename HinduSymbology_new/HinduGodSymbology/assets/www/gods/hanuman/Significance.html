<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Hanuman means “One with the long jaw”.  Can also be translated as “Is he a man?” or ‘Monkey man’. It points to the evolution of man from apes.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
Hanuman is looked upon as an example of a true follower, true devotion. 
Hanuman spent his life comprehending the true meaning of life. Although he was very virtuous and skilled, he could not focus in his life until he understood his destined motive, which was to help Rama in his exile to rescue Sita. Hanuman is symbolic of being the most ardent of Rama followers, which can be interpreted as - a man is supposed to find out his motive in life and then follow it with a single track mind.
</p>

<p>
While most Hindus believe that Hanuman was an ape-man, scholars actually believe that Hanuman was of the Varana tribe/clan, which means one of the forest, and their symbol was an Ape. Over time, it is believed story tellers took artistic liberty and made the Varana’s ape like men.

One famous legend narrates his true devotion for Rama and Sita. After coming back to Ayodhya after victory of Rama and rescue of Sita, Rama was coroneted as the King. Sita impressed by Hanuman’s selfless duty and devotion offered him her necklace of expensive beads as a token of love and gratitude. Hanuman instantly tore the necklace and started investigating each bead individually and then dropped it to the floor. Surprised by his astonishing behavior, he was asked the reason behind his action. He said that he was looking for Rama and Sita in each bead of stone and found nothing and hence it was useless for him. He claimed Rama and Sita resided in his heart and proved so by tearing his chest apart and showing Rama and Sita in his heart.
