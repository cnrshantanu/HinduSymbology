<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>The Sanskrit word  ‘sara’ means “flow” or “essence” and ‘swa’ means “self”.
</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
The river Goddess Saraswati is worshipped by Hindus, especially students, teachers, scholars, as the Goddess of learning, knowledge, wisdom and music. 

</p>

<p>
Evidences in the form of geology, geography, archaeology, literature and satellite imaging prove beyond a doubt that a mighty river by the name of Saraswati flowed in the western part of India about 5000 years back, 100km East of the Indus River. Archeological and historical evidences further suggests that an advanced civilization emerged upon the banks of this river, and along with it the Vedic Scripture, arts, science and music of ancient Vedic times.

</p>

<p>
Rivers have always been considered by many cultures as the bringer of life, and hence the association with ‘God’. It is from this association that the current day deity of Saraswati was created - a female river goddess, considered to be the mother of the Vedas, and associated with knowledge and music.

</p>

<p>
Since knowledge is required for creation, Saraswati thus symbolizes the creative power of Brahma, and represented in Hindu Mythology as the divine consort of Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe.

</p>




<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
The most common legend goes by saying that Saraswati originated from Brahma’s Head when he was meditating for the creation of the world. Thus, Saraswati acquired all the knowledge in the process of the creation of the world. She was chosen as a companion of Brahma and resided in his abode.
Puranic stories also say that when Sarawati came down to earth with the book of knowledge it was snatched by Asuras and in shame Saraswati became a water body. Saraswati river, in the Vedic period, used to flow down from the Himalayas. Later she was relieved of the burden of being on earth, which now is understood to have dried up and lost its existence due to the curse bestowed by sage Uthathya, to god of waters, Varun, for abducting the wife of the sage.
</p>




<p><strong>Consorts:</strong></p>

<p>
Brahma: The creator of life on Earth.
</p>



<p><strong>Associated Festival:</strong></p>

<p>
Saraswati Puja is the festival associated with knowledge and music. Eastern India celebrates Saraswati Puja early in the year during March- April, on this day books are not read to show due reverence. Southern India celebrates in the later months of the year with honey being offered to Saraswati to signify purity of knowledge
