<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Called as Bala Krishna, it translates to Divine Child Krishna. He is also known as Gopala and Govinda.

</p>


<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>


<p>
Bala Krishna in the view of some Hindus is the original form of Krishna and his deeds speak more of truth and good but also show that mistakes are meant to be made, but learnt from. Bala Krishna can be seen in many paintings and depictions holding a piece of butter and stories of his mischief also substantiate the belief that children are pure and unadulterated. In fact, the moment of birth is the purest moment of one’s life.
</p>




<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>
<p>
Many stories have been weaved around Bala Krishna such as the slaying of the demon, Putana by a baby Krishna who sucked all the poison out of her breasts to finally kill her. Krishna in his childhood is said to have killed the Snake demon, Aghasura when the demon attempted to ingest his friends and himself. Bala Krishna also showed his supreme divinity to Bramha and Indra deva in his childhood, thus establishing himself as the guardians of the Vrindhavan cowherds. He and his brother Balarama together defeated the demon Kamsa, thus ending the torment of children in the region for over fifteen years. 

</p>


<p><strong>Worship:</strong></p>
<p>Although the stories of Bala Krishna and courtship of Radha Krishna are well known throughout Hindus, the specific worship of Balak Krishna is no longer in popular practice. It is now believed that early stages of Krishnaism saw the worship  of Gopala.</p>

<p><strong>Associated Festival:</strong></p>

<p>
Janmashthami is a popular festival throughout India celebrated in August-September. Rasa Lila or the reenactment of Bala Krishna’s life, Dahi Handi to depict the mischievous side of Gopala (called Uriadi in the South) are a few popular ways in which the day is celebrated.
