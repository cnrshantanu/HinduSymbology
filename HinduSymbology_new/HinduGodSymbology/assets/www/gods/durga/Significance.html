<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Durga in Sanskrit means the “Unattainable” or the “Invincible”. 
The most basic form of interpretation could be that, ‘the extent of a feminine power can never be comprehended’. 
</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
Durga is considered as the mother of the whole universe, this concept denotes the importance of a Mother in her child’s life. 
</p>

<p>
She also symbolises the strength that women possess. It is said that Durga is the source of energy behind all cosmic forces. Shiva is incomplete without Durga and can’t regenerate the power that emanates from her. This even substantiates the saying that behind every successful man there is a woman.
</p>

<p>
 This in a subtle way, keeps reminding the patriarchal society of ours how we must respect a woman since she is the source of energy to the wheels of human life. We must not undermine the potential a woman possesses. All sorts of oppression subjugated on a female must be restricted. This will eventually lead to a more successful and prosperous society.
</p>


<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
A fierce Asura named Mahisasur got a boon from Lord Brahma that he can’t be killed by any Man. This power made him invincible in front of the whole Mankind and male gods. His tyranny was getting uncontrollable and Devas started panicking in the fear of losing control over their their domain and kingdoms. This in turn, led them to go to Lord Shiva and request Parvati to accept the responsibility of vanquishing Mahisasur. Parvati underwent rigorous combat training and undertook the responsibility of saving the world from anticipated disaster.    
</p>

<p><strong>Consorts:</strong></p>
Shiva : The Regenerator of life on earth.
<p>

</p>



<p><strong>Associated Festival:</strong></p>

<p>
Durga Puja is the festival associated with power and peace on earth. India celebrates Durga Puja during autumn when Rama had invoked Goddess Durga to defeat Ravana, also known as the Akaal Bodhon or the untimely invocation. The right time of celebrating Durga puja is during the month of March and April but is followed in very few places of India.
