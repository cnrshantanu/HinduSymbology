		<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Brahma = Brah+ma (Bigger). The verbal root of the word Brahma is believed to be ‘Briha’ which means to become big, biggest or absolute. Another root of the word is ‘Brh’ to expand, grow and enlarge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>It is said that Brahma originates from Narayana’s navel amidst the top of a lotus. This description is related to cosmology and astonishingly with the big bang theory. Brahma is said to represent the creation process, which emerges after the big bang. The root meaning of the word Brahma therefore, relates to get bigger, to expand, and to grow (many relate this to the concept of the Big Bang).</p>

<p>It is from this absolute growth that the sages, who wrote the Upanishad scriptures, taught that Brahman is the ultimate essence of material phenomena (including the original identity of the human self) which cannot be seen or heard but whose nature can be known through the development of self-knowledge (atmajnana).</p>

<p>Even though Brahma is depicted as a deity, a man with 4 heads, the scriptures clearly say otherwise. Brahma is as complex and as simple as its meaning – ‘the absolute reality’.  Interpretations of the scriptures indicate that Brahma is not actually ‘God’, or to be more precise to consider ‘Brahma’ as God seems to be inaccurate. Brahma is not a being but rather surpasses all material limitations. Brahman is the manifested cosmic reality.</p>

<p>Unlike other Hindu deities, Brahma is not widely worshipped, and there is only one historical temple dedicated to Brahma in India. This is possibly because in ancient times the practice of worship was not as common as it is today. And since Brahma was understood to be a scientific concept representing the expanding and absolute nature of creation, there was little need to worship such phenomenon.  </p>

<p>
To justify this phenomenon, several Puranic legends emerged that tell stories of why Brahma is less worshipped than gods such as Vishnu, Shiva and Ganesha. Worship of Brahma started in the early Vedic age but his importance was gradually outweighed by the worship of Shiva and Vishnu. His interventions with the worldly or Godly realms were also very limited.</p>



<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>In the Puranas, Brahma had created a beautiful female deity Shatarupa (one with 100 beautiful forms). Brahma got very enticed by her and could not stop looking at her. To avoid Brahma’s gaze, Shatarupa started going in different directions and hence Brahma sprouted 5 heads, four in each direction and one at the top. Enraged Shiva, to control Brahma, cut off his top head as he felt Shatarupa being created by Brahma was like his own daughter, hence his attention was improper. Shiva even cursed Brahma to be the least worshipped by Humans, and hence there are very less temples dedicated to Brahma.</p>
