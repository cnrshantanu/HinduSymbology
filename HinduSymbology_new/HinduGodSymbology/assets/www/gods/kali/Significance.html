<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Kali is derived from the word Kaal which means Time and another meaning is Darkness.

</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>

Kali is one of the forms of Parvati in her fierce state. Even Kali is considered as the mother of Universe and signifies the energy behind it.
</p>

<p>

She is shown as very dusky in color as she is the manifestation of consciousness or Brahman in its supreme un-manifested state (simply put – the blackness of vacuum). She has no permanent qualities and she will exist even when the universe ends. It is therefore believed that the concepts of color, light, good, bad do not apply to her — she is the pure, un-manifested energy.
</p>

<p>
The spiritual significance is very relevant to the philosophical aspect of the world. Quoting Rama Krishna,  “My Mother is the principle of consciousness. She is Akhanda Satchidananda (indivisible Reality), Awareness, and Bliss. The night sky between the stars is perfectly black. The waters of the ocean depths are the same; The infinite is always mysteriously dark. This inebriating darkness is my beloved Kali.”

</p>


<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Durga summoned Kali to help her vanquish Asura Raktabija. Defeating Raktabija had become impossible since each drop of his blood that fell on the ground was replicated by his own clone. Goddess Kali came in a fearful form with emaciated skin and bloodshot eyes. It is known as per puranas that she sucked blood of Raktabija and then cut his head off to finally destroying the powerful Asura. Overjoyed Kali went on a killing spree and punished all the sinners on the face of earth. Fearing mass destruction, Shiva her consort lay down on her Path. Kali in her ignorance stepped on her husband and felt embarrassed. This led her to finally calm down.

<p><strong>Associated Festival:</strong></p>

<p>
Kali Puja is a renowned festival celebrated in West Bengal, Odisha and Assam. It coincides with Diwali (Festival of lights) or Lakshmi Puja, which is celebrated throughout India.  She is worshipped at night with Tantric rites and mantras. Kali Puja was introduced in early 18th century by King Krishnachandra.
