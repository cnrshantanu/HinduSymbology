<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
From the book Understanding Shiv by D K Hari and D K Hema Hari, we come to learn that the word Shiva simply means Mangalam or Auspicious, this is derived from a saying ‘Shivasthe Panthanaha’, meaning “let your way be auspicious”. Broken down Shiva can be split into Sha-ee+va, where Sha stands for Shareem or body, ee stands for eehwari or life giving energy, and Va stands for vayu or motion. Thus Shiva represents the body with life and motion, Shava (shavasana in yoga) means lifeless body.</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
The scientific meaning of Shiva is to deep to be discussed here. The fact that everything needs to be destroyed before anything new is created is the main of concept behind Shiva. Shiva represents the regenerative element in the process of Creation. 

</p>

<p>
Shiva conveys via his symbology that true power is in the humble realization of authority. Shiva is personification of consciousness. One can achieve the maximum state of consciousness solely by meditation with only the purest intentions and state of mind. This is symbolized by his half open and half closed eyes. One should attain inner peace to gain such tranquility. Taming the restless mind should be the aspiration of a person who wants to get to the state where Shiva resides. The third eye of wisdom signifies that our perceptions should not just rely on what we see but also what we evaluate and feel.  

</p>

<p>
Followers of Hinduism who focus their worship upon Shiva are called Shaivites or Shaivas (Sanskrit Saiva) Shiva is usually worshipped in the abstract form of Shiva Linga. In images, he is represented as immersed in deep meditation and dancing the Tandava dance upon Apasmara, the demon of ignorance in his manifestation of Nataraja, the Lord of the dance.

<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Samudra Manthan or churning up of the oceanic water bodies with toxin was leading to the destruction of mankind, when Shiva took the responsibility to filter out all the poison and drink it as it could not be destroyed by any means. Parvati strangled Shiva’s neck when he drank the poison and limited its toxicity only till his neck, this resulted in the change of color of the neck to blue and hence the name Neel Kantan or the one with the blue neck.
