<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
‘Vishwa’ means universal, ‘Rupa’ means form. The word ‘Vishwarupa’ means the universal omnipresent form of or God. 
</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
When one looks at any image or statue of Vishwarupa, you will notice that many other Hindu Gods are represented as part of the imagery. The core significance of ‘Vishwarupa’ is represented by the fact that it is an embodiment of all Gods in one. This depicts that God is one, universal, and omnipresent. Vishwarupa is intimidating in nature as it depicts destruction of all negative aspects of humanity and only reflects the positive side. 
</p>

<p>
The concept of and name ‘Vishwarupa’ proceeds the popular belief that Krishna revealed his divine self on the battlefield and spoke to Arjuna. Since it is believed that Krishna, who Hindus believe was an incarnation or avatar of Vishnu, revealed his divine self, ‘Vishwarupa’ has more commonly being associated with Vishnu type features. 
</p>

<p>
By depicting ‘Vishwarupa’ as a ‘Vishnu’ type god, the concept of ‘Vishwarupa’ has been diluted. And the primary significance that God is One, has become lost in translation.
Popular Beliefs
</p>


<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
In the historical Mahabharatha, Arjuna was getting cold feet just before the battle against his cousins the Kauravas as he was in moral dilemma. His fight for justice and righteousness was threatened. To convince Arjuna about concept of duty and true life path Krishna transformed and showed his Vishwarupa. Arjuna overwhelmed by the supreme figure and the life discourse understood importance of doing Dharma.

</p>

<p>
‘Vishwarupa’ can also interpreted as “the story of evolution,” as the individual evolves in this world doing more and more with time. The Vishwarupa Darshan is a cosmic representation of all the Hindu Gods and Goddesses, Sages and Asuras, good and the bad as we perceive in our own particular perspective of existence in this world. 
</p>

<p>
The fact that Hindu’s believe in the concept of Vishwarupa, is somewhat contrary to the belief that there are so many individual Gods and Goddesses. In Vishwarupa we find that there is only one universal God, and the many gods are symbolic aspects of the one God, which is actually formless, yet like many aspects of Hinduism has a form associated with him.
