		<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>Ganesha = Gana+Esha (Senses + Lordship). The root of the word Ganesha thus can be considered to translate into &lsquo;Lordship over the senses&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>Ganesha is the deity worshipped as the remover of obstacles or at the commencement of a new venture. When we look at the root of the word Ganesha we can see that is translates into &lsquo;lordship over the senses&rsquo;. To master the obstacles one faces in life, one must first master ones senses.</p>

<p>In another popular myth, Ganesha is mentioned as the scribe for Mahabharata, upon the request of Saint Ved Vyasa. Ganesha is said to agree to write it only on the condition that Vyasa never pauses in his recitation. In turn Vyasa agreed, provided Ganesha took the time to understand what was said before writing it down. Thereafter Ganesha is said to break off one of his tusks to write the Mahabharata.</p>

<p>Since Ganesha is symbolic, what we understand is that, the legend implies, one must possess the qualities of Ganesha in order to undertake such a detailed task of writing a poetic, philosophical and spiritual epic. High levels of wisdom, intellect, focus and patience are required to undertake such tasks. All character traits associated with Ganesha.</p>

<p>Ganesha worship seems to have increased in popularity during the highly successful Gupta Period spanning from 320 C.E. to 550 C.E. and today is one of the most worshipped of all Hindu Idols. Unlike most of the other primary Hindu Gods, Ganesha does not represent nature or creation but falls into a category more relevant to spiritual and personal development.</p>

<p>Ganesha falls into a category of Hindu Deities, such as Laxmi &amp; Saraswati which seems to represent and guide ideal human behavior. These concepts and what can be learned from such idols seem to be similar to modern day personal and development books.</p>

<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>Ganesha is the unborn son of Parvati whom she created using the scurf of her body that got accumulated after a lot of uninterrupted devotion and meditation. It is said that she created Ganesha as her sole ally who was strictly dedicated for her protection and was directly answerable to only his mother, Parvati.</p>

<p>Lord Shiva tried to enter <em>Parvati&rsquo;s </em>chamber while she was taking bath, Ganesha being at the door and oblivious of his identity prohibited him to get inside. Shiva was taken aback; he proclaimed his superiority and demanded to get inside as he could go wherever he wanted to.</p>

<p><em>Ganesha </em><em>resist</em><em>s</em> victoriously all the army sent by him and other Gods. As a final resort <em>Shiva</em> himself entered the battlefield and cut off <em>Ganesha&rsquo;s</em> head to finally enter the chamber. Enraged Parvati is finally consoled after Shiva replaces his head with an Elephant&rsquo;s head and makes him the <em>God of all Beginning and Senses.</em></p>
