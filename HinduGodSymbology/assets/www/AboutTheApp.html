				In the ancient scriptures of Hinduism, such as the Vedas, Upanishads and scriptures such as Yoga Vasistha, the wisdom taught to Rama by Saint Vasistha and Bhagavad Gita, the wisdom Krishna spoke to his dear friend Arjuna on the Kurashetra battlefield, and the central part of the epic poem Mahabharata one thing is very clear, God is describes as formless and omnipresent.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the question that arises is why are their so many deities in Hinduism.  When one understands a simple concept, the answer becomes clear. The deities, in the forms of statues, paintings, calendars, keychains, etc are symbolic in nature.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Rishis of the ancient times knew that the ancient wisdom would not be easily comprehendible as humanity moved towards their future. As such the Puranas emerged telling incredible stories of Gods, Demons and Humans. These stories teach teach values, morality, good vs. evil. These are the stories that most Hindus are told from a very young age, and the rituals are festivals around this Puranic myths are what most Hindus practice. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What is less commonly understood is the significance of these stories and deities. The deities and their stories, be they mythological or itihasa's (based on historical fact) were created to help us remember ancient wisdom covering the knowledge of cosmology, astrology, self-awareness, mind-mastery, phycology, and much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Hindu God Symbology App was created to help people better understand the symbolic significance of the various Hindu Deities, and the meaning of the symbols they hold in their hands, the ornaments that adorn their bodies, their posture, and associated colors.
			</p>
			<p>
				As you will discover, the deities and the way they have been conceptualized is extremely creative. By understanding the symbology we start to gleem the ancient wisdom encoded in the images and idols of the numerous Gods of Hinduism.
			</p>
			<p>
				These deities representing the many aspects of God, where not created to be simply worshiped, they serve a higher purpose of helping us to better understand the vast wisdom of Hinduism.
			</p>
			<p>
				Countless hours have been spent research the symbolic meanings, getting the information verified by 3rd party scholar's and experts. While we have done our best to bring you accurate information, we also understand that people and experts can have different interpretations. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In our work, it is not our intention to offend anyone's beliefs, but to simply bring forward knowledge that has been brushed aside, diluted, dismissed, forgotten over the ages.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many regard Hinduism as one of the world's major organized religions. As our research shows, there is very little that can be classified as organized. On the contrary, one can even dispute if Hinduism should even be classified as one of the world religions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				By classifying all that is Hinduism many of the worlds cultures have been robbed of an ocean of wisdom dating back over 10,000 years, and maybe more. Within the context of Hinduism exist ancient wisdom, scriptures, varying beliefs and spiritual system, historical facts, mythological stories, science, cosmology, astrology, mathematics, Ayurvedic health principles and much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through our work at www.ReThinkHinduism.com, we hope to inspire Hindu's and non-Hindu's to better understand Hinduism and all that it contains.
