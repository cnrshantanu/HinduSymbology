<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>

</p>
Derived from the Sanskrit word, Karthik
It means, one who bestows happiness and courage. The meaning can be translated as overcoming the struggle of life to become perfect and thus achieve happiness.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
Karthikeya Is also known as Murugan and Subrahmanya. Karthikeya is characterized as the God of War and is also considered as perfection. The core significance and symbolism attached to him dictates that, in our life we are at a constant War. The victory over any life situation or basic desires gives us the self-satisfaction and is an impetuous for us to become the “perfect man”.
</p>

<p>
Karthikeya is master of the state of God Consciousness, characterizing a state of higher consciousness, which can be achieved only after transcending from the 3 states innate to a Man i.e. State of Consciousness, State of Dream and state of Deep sleep. This makes a human realize the purpose and the core reason of his/her existence.
</p>

<p>
Karthikeya rides a peacock, which signifies the vanity that should be kept in check by a human. The peacock is shown to clutch a serpent, which signifies ego must be controlled by oneself to attain perfection.
</p>

<p>
Karthikeya as symbol suggests a Human being to do a reality check in his/her life. Mere intellectual, physical and material desires should not encompass our whole existence in this world. One must denounce such false vanities and aim to develop true vanities of Infinite being. 
Karthikeya falls in the same category like Ganesha in which a person is supposed to emulate the qualities symbolized by this deity. Hence, Karthikeya has been revered quite popularly in India and some parts of South East Asia.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Karthikeya, the son of Parvati and Shiva, was born to vanquish Asura (demon) Taraka who could only be slayed by Shiva’s son. Taraka had started spreading his tyranny after Shiva went into a deep Yogic mediation following his first wife Sati’s self- immolation to pay penance for Shiva, who had been insulted at her father’s Grand feast. Hence, the union of Parvati (reincarnation of Sati) and Shiva later on gave birth to Karthikeya.
</p>

<p>
Karthikeya, as an infant, is believed to have been nurtured and taken care of by Apsaras (Celestial Dancers) from Indra deva’s court. He received Mother’s Milk from all of them and as a result of which he became very virtuous and beautiful. He vanquished Asura Taraka as a young boy and achieved blessings of all the Gods.
</p>
