<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Naraha means water and Ayana means resting. Alternatively, Narayana also suggests Nara, which means Man and Ayana meaning Direction. The direct interpretation can be - the man with direction towards self-realization or quite simply put, ‘knowing one’s true aim in life’. The indirect interpretation is, ‘the existence of the Universe’.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>
The scientific significance of Narayana is related to the concept of creation of the universe. Famous cosmologists from the laboratory, CERN say that the process of creation of universe is synonymous to the concept of Narayana.
</p>

<p>
He is the embodiment of the five primordial states of the Universe: Space, Air, Fire, Water and Earth, which is also signified by the 5 heads of the Adishesha (the snake that Narayana rests upon). Narayana resides in the cosmic waters, which in turn translates as the primordial or fundamental soup of quarks and gluons (tiny building blocks of matter and obviously life), which are not bound by any force, just like Narayana himself.

</p>

<p>
Spiritually, Narayana is the enlightenment that a man must try to achieve, which may be deemed as the ultimate goal of any self realized human being. Transcendence or self realization can’t be explained, it can only be felt by the one who achieves it. Imagine Buddha, Jesus Christ etc. achieving self-realization that got them closer to God. Narayana is the source of creation of life on earth manifested by Brahma. Hence he is also considered as the ‘Ultimate Being’. 

</p>

<p>
There are very few places of worship of Narayana as the concept behind worshipping him is very profound and complex. Only a few among millions of devotees can reach the state of getting completely submerged in Narayana or achieve such a high level of enlightenment. 

</p>

<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Narayana is considered to be the original creator of the universe who resides in a mythical place called the Sweta Deepa at an eternally blissful Vaikuntha, which is believed to be a planet.  He presides in the Milk ocean and his power prevails throughout the universe. He is the Supreme creator of the Universe and Brahma (Generator), Vishnu (Operator) and Maheshwara (Regenerator) are extensions of him.
</p>

<p>
Narayana, is also identified as the original man or Purusha. He is considered as the epicenter of creation and the universe eventually expands from him.
