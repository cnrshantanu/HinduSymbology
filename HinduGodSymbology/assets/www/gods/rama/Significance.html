<p><strong>Etymology: </strong>
Rama means dwelling and Sita means plough in Sanskrit. Each of the names is significant, with Rama being all pervasive and Sita being the symbol of fertility.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiritual and Scientific Significance</strong></p>

<p>

Spiritually The Ramayana personifies Rama as an embodiment of ideal qualities. As a son, friend, husband, master and ruler. He was an Ideal without any parallel. Rama has 16 traits that can be followed by a human to walk the path of righteousness. Rama possessed lots of qualities that serve as a benchmark for any person wishing to reach the highest level of being.
</p>

<p>
Rama’s alter ego is Ravana, described as a demon with ten heads. These ten heads are the six vices, namely desire, anger, greed, infatuation, pride and jealousy and Manas (mind), Buddhi(intellect), Chitta (will) and Ahamkaara (Ego). Since these ten are present in every human being, all men have the qualities of Ravana. Ultimately, Rama slays ten headed Ravana, which signifies - whoever beheads all these ten heads, rises above these qualities becomes a Rama, achieves god realization.
</p>

<p>
Rama is the central figure in the famous Hindu epic Ramayana and is believed to have been born around 5114BC. This fact has been collaborated through astrological and archaeological dating. Thus, Rama is not a mythological person, nor can the Ramayana be considered or called a mythology.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Popular Belief</strong></p>

<p>
Hindus believe Rama is the 7th incarnation of Vishnu. Rama, along with his brother Laskshmana and devote follower, Hanumana were instrumental in defeating armies of Asuras during their period of exile. There are many legends associated with Rama, the most famous one being his victory over an almost immortal and the most powerful Asura King of all time, the Rakshas (demon) King Ravana. 
</p>

<p>
Rama was the prince of Ayodhya and Son of King Dashrath and Queen Kausalya. He was sent to exile of 14 years on the whim of Kaikeyi (a wife of King Dashrath) as she wanted her son Bharath to be anointed as the King of Ayodhya. Rama being the ideal son went into exile accompanied with his obedient and loving wife Sita, protective and perfect brother Lakshman (who also insisted upon joining his brother). Rama spent 14 years in the forests and killed many evil Asuras (Demons).

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Consorts:</strong></p>

<p>
Hindu’s regard Rama as the ideal Purusha (Ideal Man) and his wife Sita as Prakrithi (Nature). Scientifically their combination is interpreted as, Rama and Sita are inseparable.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Worship Festival:</strong></p>

<p>The chanting of the mantra Hare Krishna-Hare Rama is one of the most common and wide spread ways Rama is worshippe</p>
<p><strong>Associated Festival:</strong></p>

<p>
Ramnavami and Dusshera are the festivals celebrated in honor of Rama. On Dusshera Rama had vanquished Ravana who had abducted his wife. And so, a big effigy of Ravana is burnt to symbolize the same on this day.
