HinduSymbology
==============

the apk is just a dummy apk. .
it consists of a set of HTML pages . . 
so everything is happening in one activity
Now we need to convert it into a proper android application..
For example the list of Gods will turn into a list activity. .

We are still not sure how to store the data . .  but using SQLLite would be a good option

Note : Its an offline app. . .So all we have to do is store data in a proper format . . As we have to pull it in different activities. .

I am in office, so u can coordinate with saugat when u find time

The target sdk is 2.3 gingerbread
